Linear Regression, Neural Networks, SVM, Decision Trees, etc., are common supervised learning algorithms. An unsupervised learning model is trained on unlabeled data, where the algorithm tries to search out structures or patterns in the input data without explicit output labels. Principal Component Analysis, K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, etc., are common unsupervised learning algorithms.
